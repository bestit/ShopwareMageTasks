## Installation

### Step 1: Composer

Currently the package is not registered on Packagist, so you will have to tell composer about it manually.
You can do so by putting the following content in your composer.json file:

```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/bestit/ShopwareMageTasks"
        }
    ]
```

Then from the command line, run:

```
composer require bestit/shopware-mage-tasks
```

### Step 2: .mage.yml

Create a .mage.yml file in your project root directory and define your desired tasks as per the example above.
For more information about what you can do check out the [documentation](http://magephp.com/).

### Step 3: That's it!

You just need to run the deployment script:

```
vendor/bin/mage deploy <environment>
```
